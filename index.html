                <h1>Version Control</h1>
                <p>Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source
                    code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind
                    of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of
                    the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members. For almost all software
                    projects, the source code is like the crown jewels - a precious asset whose value must be protected.
                    For most software teams, the source code is a repository of the invaluable knowledge and understanding
                    about the problem domain that the developers have collected and refined through careful effort. Version
                    control protects source code from both catastrophe and the casual degradation of human error and unintended
                    consequences.</p>
